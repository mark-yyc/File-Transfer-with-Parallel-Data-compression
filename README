Group Members:
- Yicheng Yang
  
### Instructions for Executing:
Just run run.sh in the folder, it will do the following steps:
- Compile
- Create a new folder "bin" that is used for storing metadata and compressed file
- Generate a random text file (one of dataset)
- Test on compression and decompression
- Check consistency between output file and original file Using md5, this step might require sudo
- Test on data compression in different number of thread
- Clean all the generating file and directory

### File structure
1. serial_encoder, serial_decoder
   Serial version of data compression/decompression
2. parallel_encoder, parallel_decoder
   Parallel version of data compression/decompression
3. single_sender, single_receiver
   Serial version of TCP socket based file transfer
4. parallel_sender, parallel_receiver
   Parallel version of TCP socket based file transfer
5. /report
   All the original resources for my project, including a html and markdown version of report.
6. /data
